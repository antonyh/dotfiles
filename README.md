Antony's dotfiles

My dotfiles, so I can share them between machines. Mostly Bash aliases

File: bash aliases
symlinks to ~/.bash_aliases
- sets up aliases for pbcopy/pbpaste
- does keychain/ssh-agent stuff (not really an alias) on Linux

File: install.sh
simple setup that creates the symlinks and sets eXecutable bit

---
I'm using this on Linux mostly now.
