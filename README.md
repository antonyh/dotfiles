Antony's dotfiles

My dotfiles, so I can share them between machines. Mostly Bash config (.bashrc, .bash_profile)

File: bashrc
symlinks to ~/.bashrc
Sets the prompt to time, path, git branch
Adapted from a dotfile found on the internet (apologies, if I find out where I'll reference it)

File: bash_profile
symlinks to ~/.bash_profile
some enviro vars
setup for ruby rvm, java, maven

File: install.sh
simple setup that creates the symlinks and sets X bit
